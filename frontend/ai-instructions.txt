Lets talk about CSS and Svelte.
I want this to be a mobile app with a
Floating Access Button and a 
Joystick with X/Y slider at the 
bottom of the app

The FAB should afford a new app context 
where you can change settings including 
loading a chapter from the server.

This application is a Book Chapter Reader.
It is able to load JSON data,
The schema is 
Chapter
 -Section
  -Paragraph
   -Sentences

Joystick is multimodal, set in the FAB
Color picker: X will map to a spectrum of colors for
foreground, Y maps to background.
